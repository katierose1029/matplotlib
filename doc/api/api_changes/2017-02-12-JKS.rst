Changes to PDF backend methods
``````````````````````````````

The methods `embedTeXFont` and `tex_font_mapping` of
`matplotlib.backend_pdf.PdfFile` have been removed.
It is unlikely that external users would have called
these methods, which are related to the font system
internal to the PDF backend.
