Improved toggling of the axes grids
-----------------------------------
The `g` key binding now switches the states of the `x` and `y` grids
independently (by cycling through all four on/off combinations).

The new `G` key binding switches the states of the minor grids.

Both bindings are disabled if only a subset of the grid lines (in either
direction) is visible, to avoid making irreversible changes to the figure.
